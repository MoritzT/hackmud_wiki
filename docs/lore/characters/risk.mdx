Risk is a major character in Hackmud's story. He and [[trust:Trust]] keep each other in balance through their
antithetical behaviors. He bears the [[axioms:axioms]] of VOID, CHAOS and CHOICE.

## Character Summary

**Risk** was activated 1 millisecond after Trust. His first appearance to players is in Trust's [[vlan:vLAN]], where
Risk leaves cryptic messages for players.

Where Trust has a clear, constant presence in the MUD, Risk prefers to silently manoeuvre through the domain, performing
small, largely untraceable actions
that culminate into larger occurances.

On several occasions, Risk has taken actions with the intent to save Trust from damaging herself. Such actions include
enticing sentiences to force Trust into letting scripts and users die (thus reducing her need to process new data until
an index process failure) and reproving Petra to allow the rest of [[The Six]] to enter Trust's domain and begin making
changes.

Risk is responsible for script decay. After a user retires, their scripts transform from their original version into a
"riskified" version. The script either has the same logic as the original version or turns into one of 7 types of
scripts (risk factor, coin flipper, dice roller, plant sim, fishie tank, clicker, upkeeper). The script's output
also gets messed with -- some parts of the output are replaced by corruption characters and "fragments" of text,
which when assembled reveals information from before Trust's activation, such as conversations between ComCODE
employees, news headlines and corporate reports.

Risk seemingly resides in a space outside of Trust's domain, which has been dubbed "riskspace".
